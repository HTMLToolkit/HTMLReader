# HTMLReader
A quick HTML-based EPub Reader.

This is a single .html file ebook reader. Download the standalone file in the Releases tab.
A lot of stuff doesn't work and this is only for EPub books.

Also, you can check it out at https://nellowtcs.github.io/HTMLReader/ if you don't want to run it from the HTML.
